# AdventOfCode2022

All my submission of this years' AoC written in Kotlin. Each file contains all the code to compute the solution from that day, except some code in [utils.kt](https://github.com/Malox10/AdventOfCode2022/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/utils.kt) for reading the input files

Most Part2s are accessed by uncommenting the right lines in the `main` function
